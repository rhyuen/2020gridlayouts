                <p>
                    CanSecWest, the world's most advanced conference focusing on applied digital security, is about
                    bringing the industry luminaries together in a relaxed environment which promotes collaboration and
                    social networking. The conference lasts for three days and features a single track of thought
                    provoking presentations, each prepared by an experienced professional and talented educator who is
                    at the cutting edge of his or her field. We give preference to new and innovative material,
                    highlighting important, emergent technologies, techniques, or best industry practices.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The conference is single track, with one hour presentations over the duration beginning at 9:00 a.m.
                    The registration fee includes the catered meals, and there will be a vendor display and
                    lounge/eating area, where wireless internet access will be available (as well as in the speaking
                    theater).

                    PWN2OWN @ CanSecWest is switching to full remote for this year.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The team there is adjusting as best and as quickly as they can. We plan to be posting update videos,
                    and information from the contest on our remote conference stream. The ZDI blog will list new details
                    shortly. We are all collaborating furiously to pull it all together under tight deadlines. The team
                    at Trend Micro is doing an amazing job under ever changing and dynamic conditions, and I am grateful
                    for their continuing support and amazing skills.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are actually building a pretty interesting virtual show, under the gun, but the content is
                    falling into place, we'll have remote and local participant panels in the breaks between
                    presentations, some fun attendee contests and more. It would have been nicer to get more preparation
                    time, but the folks pulling it together are doing an amazing job, on both remote courses, and our
                    new virtual hybrid conference.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We will be offering a 25% discount on CanSecWest 2021 registrations for folks whose travel and risk
                    reduction restrictions preclude physical participation this year and need to switch their
                    registration to remote tickets. And one notes their allies, friends and supporters the most in the
                    difficult times most of all, so all who are registered this year get a 15% discount on next year.
                    For folks who are locked into travel with non-refundable tickets, and whose personal situations and
                    locations place them in lower risk categories and are among the folks who will persevere and travel
                    either locally or are in lower risk demographics, we will not cancel on our commitments, we will be
                    putting on a smaller, safer show, locally and remotely. Folks from high-risk locations and among
                    threatened demographics switching to remote or cancelling is a blessing and a curse here.

                    Currently IMHO I feel privileged to live in Canada, as aggressive testing and contact tracing
                    building on our learning experiences with the previous SARS outbreak has led to a successful
                    containment so far here - the odds of coming across virus exposure currently in BC with less than 40
                    cases among a population of 5 million are currently lower than your odds of being killed by
                    lightning, to temper folk's risk assesments among the sea of hyperbole we are being subjected to,
                    and you have much better odds of winning money in the provincial lottery still. IMHO aggressive
                    testing is the key in this situation, and the difference between safe locales and higher risk lies
                    in visibility, data, and information to guide folk's response and plans - Korea, China, Canada and
                    other places that have ramped up testing, promoted mask use, and let folks have the tools to deal
                    with it tactically seem to have gotten it right with their strategies. I wish us all good luck, and
                    a reminder than panic is never a good option. Clean hands, masks on, and open hearts - stay calm,
                    and safe.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now we still have a tremendous amount of work to do with this newfangled kind of event in this
                    dynamic situation next week, so off we go. On the upside, we are looking at this as an opportunity
                    to craft a new kind of event, local and remote, removing more of our geophysical boundaries.
                </p>
                <p>
                    REMOTE UPDATE
                </p>
                <p>
                    Well the real world may be filled with uncertainty, but the virtual world marches on.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are proceeding to attempt make CanSecWest Remote the coolest on-line infosec educational resource
                    we can, and the best virtual party attempted so far.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are upping the passes so that anyone who has switched to a virtual attendance gets four remote
                    seats for their co-workers and friends.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Anyone who has ever been a volunteer, dojo instructor, presenter, or otherwise helped out at any of
                    our conferences also is eligible complementary attendance to this virtual shindig, message me here
                    with your email address for the conf invite and preferrably a signal number as some of the
                    co-ordination is happening on that platform, cc cansecwestcore@gmail.com with that info and we'll
                    get you on "the list."
                </p>
                <p>
                    We will also be extending liberal remote passes for our sponsors, we'll contact your folks early
                    next week.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This all feels like a time warp back to 15 years ago when we didn't really plan very much and things
                    were very chaotic. Any plans you make today seem to obsolete tomorrow, we just ripped up all our
                    event sheets with the hotel and are redoing our new plans for the remaining who will persevere, and
                    our remote broadcast team. If anyone local wants to come help out with the remote conference
                    management and learn with us on this brave new "technical adventure," ping me. Oddly, due to our
                    earlier experiences with chaotic rapidly deployed arrangements this is a situation we are very
                    practiced at and feels vaguely familiar from a long time ago.

                    Keith M Myers will be playing some virtual music sets on the evening part of this stream which is on
                    PST times. Going to reach out to a few other of the usual DJ villains to see about queing them up
                    for the evening part of the broadcast, so folks stuck at home not going anywhere can pour a glass of
                    scotch, or a shot of tequila (It's not just for breakfast anymore), and join what will be likely
                    multiple virtual rooms to mingle with peers while you are stuck telecommuting from home.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We will update the website shortly with more instructions and the at least 4-5 new remote
                    presentations we are adding to the new longer and fuller remote stream agenda, and I am taking this
                    opportunity to call out to our Dojo instructors for courses that have cancelled, or even our past
                    instructors to see if they are interested in doing little short mini-trainings (tentatively planning
                    on 15 min) as samples of their longer training material for attendees during the duration of the
                    conferences, potentially in parallel at the same time as the virtual party track in the evening. We
                    are still taking submissions for more remote sessions as the remote format allows us more timeslots
                    for presentations and easily added virtual sub-groups, message me directly with your pitch. Got a
                    cool infosec related idea you want to try with a remote group, tell me about it, the agenda is being
                    built very dynamically. Also still taking applications for folks to join the content co-ordination
                    and wrangling team, even remotely, so if you are interested in participating in the back end of this

                    The conference will feature a single track speaker presentation meeting stream and at least one
                    "hallway track" meeting for attendees to mingle as well as many interactive panels and discussions
                    as we can manage. We may also have break-out topical subgroups in the time the main stream is not
                    active.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The other upside to just having hauled the gear for 500 person conferences to the hotel that is no
                    longer needed, is that our remote streaming control room will have a ridiculously overkill stereo
                    system and av setup. The much smaller viewing and interaction areas for the remote streams for
                    locally present folks will also benefit from our killing a fly with an RPG tech overkill. Never a
                    dull moment.

                    Way back in 2001 we were the first conference that I know of that attempted conference wide WiFi, we
                    have been pioneers in bug bounties, discussions of many classes of vulns and tried new approaches in
                    so many other ways. We certainly intend to be pioneers in remote interactions... because it seems
                    many folks will be limited to those for the next few months. Onward and upward.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    So CanSecWest is coming up soon.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We've been watching the recent developments carefully, and working to put in several new features we
                    have never tried before and are changing some aspects dramatically. Bear with us, we are shooting
                    from the hip too, and all in all, we think we've been able to scrape up a pretty good response with
                    a dynamic situation. Folks say the key to leadership in situations like these is rapid, clear,
                    information dissemination, and calm, logical preparations. So here is what's going on....
                </p>
                <p>
                    We've put in a full virtualization team, and are drastically adjusting some parameters, read on....
                    If this is the new normal for the next while, we intend to make this experience as close to a model
                    of reduced risk social group interactions as we can.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At the end of the day I think the folks we get at our conferences are some of the most responsible
                    and intelligent folks on the planet, and if there is any group I would trust with the social
                    awareness to show the responsibility to stay back and self-isolate if they have any inkling of
                    symptoms, fever, cough, even a runny nose, it's the infosec community that attends our conferences.
                    One of the reasons we do what we do is because the folks we interact with in our community really
                    are some of the world's finest and most competent whom we rely on in positions of trust. The
                    percentages of folks who are really asymptomatic is, contrary to some fearful exclamations, very
                    low, around 1% by all the data published so far. In any cases where there was any asymptomatic
                    transmission, the folks involved did eventually see symptoms. New data suggests that the median
                    symptom onset (50%) is 5.1 days (with over 97% at less than 11 days, and almost all by 14 days), and
                    nearly all of the cases include fever as a primary symptom. So monitoring those is crucial as we see
                    it, and are putting in IR camera temperature monitoring, and stringent requests of attendees to
                    redouble caution and withdrawal in case of _any_ illness. All our desks will have IR thermometers in
                    case of any doubts available for checks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We will have masks, hand sanitizer stations, and sanitizer bottles (but still recommend hand washing
                    frequently as preferrable), as well as alcohol wipes for attendees for their own area sanitization.
                    We will recommend that masks be the default at conference activities, and will have a keynote on
                    proper sanitization, and mask use and safe removal and disposal from a registered nurse.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That said, we will however implement a different kind of conference this year as a dynamic response:
                </p>
                <p>
                    For the first time ever we will allow folks to remotely attend the conference in full "virtual
                    mode." We can't get enough telepresence robots to make it practical for individuals :-) but we are
                    putting in a team of folks to function as camera folks, producers, remote support team, bringing in
                    special equipment and a running tech trials already and the rest of the week to make sure it will
                    run smoothly. It's a little like a live event TV broadcast, something I do happen to know a bit
                    about after having worked in that industry. We will have some more announcements about this after
                    our technology tests are complete.
                    We are doing a record number of remote presentations, which is putting in a lot more prep logistics
                    for our new expanded team. All the folks coming to present from any high risk areas and folks with
                    corporate travel restrictions are switching to remote presentations and virtual attendance. We will
                    have infrastructure and operators to have cameras in the audience for questions, and the presenters
                    will be able to see their audiences for live q/a and reactions.
                    One of our most popular courses, the Baseband Dojo, has an Israeli instructor (see news about recent
                    travel restrictions). We have mobilized our virtual team this weekend and arranged for a remote
                    course for him, with a local TA, and conference cams for all the students. This involved quite a bit
                    of logistics to make sure that the course equipment which has been bouncing back and forth in
                    shipments was located and redirected and backup equipment arranged in case of issues.
                    We will remote enable five Dojos, and allow registrants to join locally or remotely:
                    Nitay Artenstein: Practical Baseband Exploitation
                    John Bambenek: Hunting the Adversary, Applying Cyber-Threat Intelligence
                    Josh Watson: Automated Reverse Engineering with Binary Ninja
                    Ashfaq Ansari: Windows Kernel Exploitation, Foundations
                    Ashfaq Ansari: Windows Kernel Exploitation, Advanced
                    For the dojos and the conference in general we have adjusted our seating arrangements to attempt to
                    follow "social distancing" guidelines, and are placing all the seating with a preferrence for a
                    minimum of 1 meter apart (roughly the primary danger zone for coughs and sneezes). In the main hall
                    we will shoot for 2-3 meter seat spacing, a benefit of the mixed blessing of putting a few hundred
                    folks in a room that seats 800. We are also recommending mask usage using supplied masks at the
                    dojos and conference, and related events as a pre-emptive precaution.
                    We have adjusted all catering to eliminate shared serving utensil handling, to minimize risk as much
                    as possible, as well as increasing seating area social distancing at eating areas.
                    The Party: Originally we had booked a night club on Granville Street, called The Venue, with a "DJ
                    Dojo" and interactive DJ competition and tutorial for the partygoers on Thursday night. We are
                    cancelling and shifting/moving this event. Our goal is to adjust this event to minimize the need for
                    confined conversation in close quarters, so a loud, dim, dark bar is probably not the right answer.
                    We are going to take a financial hit and cancel the paid for event. However we still have a few
                    hundred folks who will wish to socialize, and we want to facilitate that in the safest possible
                    environment we can manage. So we are setting up the "DJ Dojo," in a large well lit area with lots of
                    space, with inflatable, easy to sterilize with alcohol inflatable plastic furniture, and chairs and
                    tables so folks can interact without having to yell at each other in close quarters in a loud, dark,
                    bar. We are planning on serving snacks and alcohol in disposable individual serving containers (no
                    hastily washed serving glass reuse, or tongs with food from bowls) in our larger lounge space, and
                    going to make it a LAN party with music instead where folks can still interact, but with safer
                    "social distancing." We will allow short lightning talk presentations at the party, from local as
                    well as remote attendees. We will have a remote conferencing telepresence party area in the room
                    with autofollowing cameras and speakers where the local attendees can interact with any remote
                    folks. Still working out the details here, and we'll announce them as they resolve.
                    At this time we still see the overall risk in Canada of transmission as low. Canada has been
                    agressively testing, and overall rapid ramp up of testing IMHO seems to be the key to containment.
                    China has managed this quite well. The Korean rapid roll-out of testing seems to be also paying off
                    as their numbers of new cases continue to decline. The situation in BC is still low risk - the only
                    case of concern at the moment is a single one (with likely multiple case fallout expected amongst
                    other residents and staff there) of seniors at the Lynn Valley center in North Vancouver - which is
                    still being traced since it was announced on Thursday of last week. Mindful of earlier SARS
                    experience, BC has implemented agressive contact tracing and readily available testing at all the
                    handful of outbreaks, and has so far been successful at avoiding unconstrained spreading.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We have arranged some RT-PCR testing should it become necessary, or optionally desireable by any
                    attendees, at a medical clinic next to the hotel for any verification, but have switched the
                    presenter we were concerned about before to a remote presentation to further minimize the risk.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As usual we continue monitoring the situation closely, and reacting dynamically as necessary, and
                    hold cautious hopes for better news for everyone from the trials of remdesivir and camostat. We also
                    advise folks to consider how to best isolate any at risk elderly male smokers or ex-smokers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Clean hands, masks on, open hearts, and we will all do our best to persevere even in adversity.

                </p>
                <p>
                    A statement from my friend Kevin Johnson got me thinking about submissions and trainings we have at
                    CanSecWest. His assertion was that the submissions for CanSecWest are intimidating. We do get some
                    really bright folks presenting, and typically you need something new and significant, but at the
                    same time as I pondered this, I was being vaguely irritated that companies don't allocate training
                    budgets for more advanced courses like we have in our Dojo trainings on younger more junior
                    employees, saving the trip for the training course as a perk for the more senior employees. Most of
                    the folks we get in our courses are more experienced folks. And I think that companies should be
                    allowing employees with promise to expand their skills and support even their more junior staffers
                    going to expand their security knowledge through training.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So here is my little nod to both of those in one, I'm going to reserve a talk slot for the best
                    paper by a new presenter, age 25 or under, in a special separate selection, judged by our talk
                    committee. I'm also going to give a free course admission to a dojo course for the top four
                    submission proposals (including the winner and presenter). So if you have a bright promising new
                    researcher at your company who has been working on something cool, maybe be a mentor, and point out
                    this opportunity for them.
                </p>
