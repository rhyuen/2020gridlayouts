                <p>
                    CanSecWest, the world's most advanced conference focusing on applied digital security, is about
                    bringing the industry luminaries together in a relaxed environment which promotes collaboration and
                    social networking. The conference lasts for three days and features a single track of thought
                    provoking presentations, each prepared by an experienced professional and talented educator who is
                    at the cutting edge of his or her field. We give preference to new and innovative material,
                    highlighting important, emergent technologies, techniques, or best industry practices.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The conference is single track, with one hour presentations over the duration beginning at 9:00 a.m.
                    The registration fee includes the catered meals, and there will be a vendor display and
                    lounge/eating area, where wireless internet access will be available (as well as in the speaking
                    theater).

                    PWN2OWN @ CanSecWest is switching to full remote for this year.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The team there is adjusting as best and as quickly as they can. We plan to be posting update videos,
                    and information from the contest on our remote conference stream. The ZDI blog will list new details
                    shortly. We are all collaborating furiously to pull it all together under tight deadlines. The team
                    at Trend Micro is doing an amazing job under ever changing and dynamic conditions, and I am grateful
                    for their continuing support and amazing skills.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are actually building a pretty interesting virtual show, under the gun, but the content is
                    falling into place, we'll have remote and local participant panels in the breaks between
                    presentations, some fun attendee contests and more. It would have been nicer to get more preparation
                    time, but the folks pulling it together are doing an amazing job, on both remote courses, and our
                    new virtual hybrid conference.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We will be offering a 25% discount on CanSecWest 2021 registrations for folks whose travel and risk
                    reduction restrictions preclude physical participation this year and need to switch their
                    registration to remote tickets. And one notes their allies, friends and supporters the most in the
                    difficult times most of all, so all who are registered this year get a 15% discount on next year.
                    For folks who are locked into travel with non-refundable tickets, and whose personal situations and
                    locations place them in lower risk categories and are among the folks who will persevere and travel
                    either locally or are in lower risk demographics, we will not cancel on our commitments, we will be
                    putting on a smaller, safer show, locally and remotely. Folks from high-risk locations and among
                    threatened demographics switching to remote or cancelling is a blessing and a curse here.

                    Currently IMHO I feel privileged to live in Canada, as aggressive testing and contact tracing
                    building on our learning experiences with the previous SARS outbreak has led to a successful
                    containment so far here - the odds of coming across virus exposure currently in BC with less than 40
                    cases among a population of 5 million are currently lower than your odds of being killed by
                    lightning, to temper folk's risk assesments among the sea of hyperbole we are being subjected to,
                    and you have much better odds of winning money in the provincial lottery still. IMHO aggressive
                    testing is the key in this situation, and the difference between safe locales and higher risk lies
                    in visibility, data, and information to guide folk's response and plans - Korea, China, Canada and
                    other places that have ramped up testing, promoted mask use, and let folks have the tools to deal
                    with it tactically seem to have gotten it right with their strategies. I wish us all good luck, and
                    a reminder than panic is never a good option. Clean hands, masks on, and open hearts - stay calm,
                    and safe.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now we still have a tremendous amount of work to do with this newfangled kind of event in this
                    dynamic situation next week, so off we go. On the upside, we are looking at this as an opportunity
                    to craft a new kind of event, local and remote, removing more of our geophysical boundaries.
                </p>
                <p>
                    REMOTE UPDATE
                </p>
                <p>
                    Well the real world may be filled with uncertainty, but the virtual world marches on.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are proceeding to attempt make CanSecWest Remote the coolest on-line infosec educational resource
                    we can, and the best virtual party attempted so far.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are upping the passes so that anyone who has switched to a virtual attendance gets four remote
                    seats for their co-workers and friends.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Anyone who has ever been a volunteer, dojo instructor, presenter, or otherwise helped out at any of
                    our conferences also is eligible complementary attendance to this virtual shindig, message me here
                    with your email address for the conf invite and preferrably a signal number as some of the
                    co-ordination is happening on that platform, cc cansecwestcore@gmail.com with that info and we'll
                    get you on "the list."
                </p>
                <p>
                    We will also be extending liberal remote passes for our sponsors, we'll contact your folks early
                    next week.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This all feels like a time warp back to 15 years ago when we didn't really plan very much and things
                    were very chaotic. Any plans you make today seem to obsolete tomorrow, we just ripped up all our
                    event sheets with the hotel and are redoing our new plans for the remaining who will persevere, and
                    our remote broadcast team. If anyone local wants to come help out with the remote conference
                    management and learn with us on this brave new "technical adventure," ping me. Oddly, due to our
                    earlier experiences with chaotic rapidly deployed arrangements this is a situation we are very
                    practiced at and feels vaguely familiar from a long time ago.

                    Keith M Myers will be playing some virtual music sets on the evening part of this stream which is on
                    PST times. Going to reach out to a few other of the usual DJ villains to see about queing them up
                    for the evening part of the broadcast, so folks stuck at home not going anywhere can pour a glass of
                    scotch, or a shot of tequila (It's not just for breakfast anymore), and join what will be likely
                    multiple virtual rooms to mingle with peers while you are stuck telecommuting from home.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We will update the website shortly with more instructions and the at least 4-5 new remote
                    presentations we are adding to the new longer and fuller remote stream agenda, and I am taking this
                    opportunity to call out to our Dojo instructors for courses that have cancelled, or even our past
                    instructors to see if they are interested in doing little short mini-trainings (tentatively planning
                    on 15 min) as samples of their longer training material for attendees during the duration of the
                    conferences, potentially in parallel at the same time as the virtual party track in the evening. We
                    are still taking submissions for more remote sessions as the remote format allows us more timeslots
                    for presentations and easily added virtual sub-groups, message me directly with your pitch. Got a
                    cool infosec related idea you want to try with a remote group, tell me about it, the agenda is being
                    built very dynamically. Also still taking applications for folks to join the content co-ordination
                    and wrangling team, even remotely, so if you are interested in participating in the back end of this
                    evolving idea contact me as well if you have some time you can spend helping out Tue-Wed next week.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The conference will feature a single track speaker presentation meeting stream and at least one
                    "hallway track" meeting for attendees to mingle as well as many interactive panels and discussions
                    as we can manage. We may also have break-out topical subgroups in the time the main stream is not
                    active.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The other upside to just having hauled the gear for 500 person conferences to the hotel that is no
                    longer needed, is that our remote streaming control room will have a ridiculously overkill stereo
                    system and av setup. The much smaller viewing and interaction areas for the remote streams for
                    locally present folks will also benefit from our killing a fly with an RPG tech overkill. Never a
                    dull moment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Way back in 2001 we were the first conference that I know of that attempted conference wide WiFi, we
                    have been pioneers in bug bounties, discussions of many classes of vulns and tried new approaches in
                    so many other ways. We certainly intend to be pioneers in remote interactions... because it seems
                    many folks will be limited to those for the next few months. Onward and upward.

                    Security Masters Dojo
                </h2>

                <p>
                    To address the need for intermediate and advanced educational requirements that go beyond the
                    introductory materials typically found in most currently existing training (which are often geared
                    towards the novice level) for professionals who already have significant work experience, and want
                    to
                    further improve their skills, we have assembled a curriculum of hands-on, one day, training programs
                    -
                    delivered by industry renowned experts who are pre-eminent in their fields.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This is information security university level training for practitioners who already have
                    substantial
                    knowledge and wish to broaden their boundaries. It goes beyond introductory level material to focus
                    and
                    delve more deeply into technical subjects that aren't addressed in other currently available
                    training.
                </p>

                probably be better informed by following @dragosr twitter feed. :-)

                    Patterned after martial arts combat training, the Security Masters Dojo will focus on real world
                    applications of new skills which can help you advance in the field of information security. You will
                    learn difficult to aquire skill sets from the world's top practitioners. A series of tests will
                    challenge and verify your skills in each course area. But you can rest assured that if you study and
                    persevere, by attaining and overcoming the challenges, you too will indeed become a world class
                    expert in information security - with an exclusive skill and knowledge level few have reached.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Our instructors are each considered to be the world's top experts in their field. Many have been
                    responsible for the creation of some of the most famous and useful security tools and methodologies
                    you probably use frequently in your normal security tasks. All have given many introductory courses
                    and are experienced instructors. They are knowledgeable in what students need to advance their
                    skills.
                    Many have created course material that other instructors still use. Each has taken that wisdom and
                    knowledge of training and refined it into material to take your understanding to the next level. Our
                    goal is
                    to empower you to be the experts in your organization so that you can help your company be an
                    information security powerhouse. Let our sensei transform your skill to the next degree of
                    intensity.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Each two day class is offered in two sessions per dojo and features one or two expert instructors
                    teaching a small group (maximum of ten people are allowed to register per session, class max 20).
                    Courses have a strong hands-on laboratory component and prepared exercises for you to perform.
                </p>

                <p>
                    To accomodate this, each class may have prerequisites for software loads and a laptop is mandatory.
                    The individual class guides will list material the students are expected have knowledge about coming
                    in to the course and software tools that need to be pre-installed before attending so you get the
                    maximum benefit from the focused intermediate or advanced level course. Please pay particular
                    attention to the prerequisites, as the material listed there will not be reviewed in the courses,
                    and will be necessary to get the maximum benefit out of these educational programs.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The small size (20) means that space is limited, so you must book early, but you will be assured
                    that the low student-instructor ratio will mean that you will each get specific attention to
                    assisting your individual learning process.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Our sensei masters have said "Hai!" to the challenge of improving your skills. I hope you choose to
                    say so too and rise to the challenge of increasing your information security knowledge.
